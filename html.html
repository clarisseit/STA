    <p class="p1">SpreadTchAfrica. Hey there, it's a great morning! I'm absolutely thrilled to be a part of the
        SpreadTchAfrica
        Bootcamp.
        This marks the beginning of my journey here. I'm eager to soak up knowledge and grow. By the way, you're welcome
        to join
        us on WhatsApp via this <a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/F2YPCxTEN2TL8plPxOqhuw">WhatsApp Link.</a>

    </p>
    <p class="p2">So, SpreadTechAfrica is all about helping people in Africa learn more about technology. They do things
        like
        workshops and
        events to teach about computers, the internet, and how to use them to make life better. It's like a group that
        wants to
        make sure everyone in Africa can use and understand technology.</p>
